# Summary: Phase 3 - Search & UX Refinement (Plan 02)

## Status
- **Goal**: Refactor the landing page and navigation to provide a professional artifact portal.
- **Status**: Completed
- **Completion Date**: 2026-02-22

## Key Deliverables
- [x] Refactored `src/pages/index.tsx` with SIB branding (title, tagline, CTA).
- [x] Replaced Docusaurus boilerplate features in `src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx` with artifact categories (Konceptuella, Normativa, Stödjande).
- [x] Updated primary call-to-action to lead directly to the artifact library.
- [x] Performed final production build and verification.

## Verification Results
- `npm run build`: Success.
- UI: Home page is fully customized and professionally branded.
- Navigation: All key links are functional and lead to valid artifact categories.

## Next Steps
- Maintain the portal by updating the sandbox repository; the sync workflow will handle the rest.
- Create new versions as needed via the Docusaurus CLI.
