# Enable Mermaid Diagram Rendering

Mermaid diagrams in Markdown are currently rendered as plain code blocks instead of visual diagrams.

**Objective**: Integrate Mermaid support into Docusaurus v3 so that `mermaid` code blocks are automatically transformed into visual diagrams.

**Key Tasks**:
- [ ] Install and configure `@docusaurus/theme-mermaid`.
- [ ] Update `docusaurus.config.ts` to enable the Mermaid theme.
- [ ] Verify that diagrams render correctly in both light and dark modes.

**Desired Outcome**: Technical diagrams are presented visually to readers, improving document clarity.
