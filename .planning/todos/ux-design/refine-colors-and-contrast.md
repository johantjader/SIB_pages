# Refine Colors and Contrast for Digg.se Alignment

The current visual style needs more work to truly match Digg.se, specifically addressing accessibility and contrast issues in both light and dark modes.

**Objective**: Audit and update the Docusaurus theme colors to ensure they mirror Digg.se while maintaining WCAG contrast standards, especially in dark mode.

**Key Issues**:
- [ ] Primary and secondary colors do not sufficiently resemble Digg.se's latest palette.
- [ ] Text contrast in dark mode is poor, making some sections hard to read.
- [ ] Ensure a consistent "white-label" look that feels like a Digg-sibling in both themes.

**Desired Outcome**: A polished, accessible UI that is visually indistinguishable from Digg.se's design patterns in both light and dark modes.
